The issue was resolved by ensuring all dependencies were up to date and explicitly specifying the version of `react-native-async-storage` within the `package.json` file.  Additionally, I checked the Expo documentation for any known issues related to React Navigation and AsyncStorage.  The solution involved updating my project's dependencies to the latest compatible versions and verifying the correct configuration for both libraries within my Expo app.  The specific commands are below:
npm update
npm install react-native-async-storage@1.17.11 // Or the latest compatible version
The `bug.js` file contains the original code causing the error. The `bugSolution.js` file has the updated version with the solution implemented.
